# Messages
This is an one to one Messaging App for Android.  
You need internet connection for sending and receiving messages.  
The App is written in Kotlin and uses Firebase for backend.   
Thirdparty library [groupie](https://github.com/lisawray/groupie) is used for RecyclerView layouts.  
Special thanks to Brian's [Kotlin Firebase Messenger course](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Kotlin-Firebase-Messenger)
